# Sensor Fusion

Files for the Sensor Fusion workshop. Use the processing file to read quaternions (plug in and run the code on the air unit before running the quaternionViewer file).

No virus in the exe file promise ðŸ¥º


If your viewer is not working, please install this:

And use the .PDE file instead
