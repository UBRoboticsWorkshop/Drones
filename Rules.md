# Rules For Drones
Power systems

•	Only the provided ESCs, motors and batteries may be used

•	Do not modify power systems on the battery side of the ESC

Frames

•	Minimum 12.5mm clearance to propellers from other parts

•	Propeller guards are mandatory, and need to extend beyond the vertical projection of the propellers

•	Drone weight cannot exceed 250g (If it weighs this much you probably should redesign it anyway)

Parts

•	Propellers must be inspected by a committee member if not default

•	Drones may be kept by members excluding lithium batteries after the competition

Code

•	Do not modify failsafe code- this code won’t negatively affect the performance of the drone, but could cause the UAV to act unexpectedly

•	The UAV may be flown with or without LiDAR and accelerometer according to user’s preference- these make flying easier, but for advanced users may slow you down
